Add support of AGPS in Huawei phone

Huawei phones under emui 8 and under 
emui 9 use an Assisted GPS system according
 to the supl 2.0 standard

The Huawei implementation uses an apk for
 this which communicates via the android APIs to the telephony part of the telephone.


This repo contains the scripts needed to generate this apk in an 
Android 11, 12 or 13 compatible format
